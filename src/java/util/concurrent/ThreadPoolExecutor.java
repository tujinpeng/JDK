 * <ul>
 *
 * <li> If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, the Executor                //当少于核心线程数的线程在运行时,有新任务来时往往都是新建个线程处理请求而不是入队
 * always prefers adding a new thread

 * always prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new
 * thread.</li>

 * this would exceed maximumPoolSize, in which case, the task will be
 * rejected.</li>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * There are three general strategies for queuing:                                 //这里有3种任务队列选择的策略:
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li> <em> Direct handoffs.</em> A good default choice for a work                //【Direct handoff 策略】：
 * queue is a {@link SynchronousQueue} that hands off tasks to threads             //这是一个好的默认的选择策略，通过SynchronousQueue实现在线程间传递任务而不是持有他们。
 * without otherwise holding them. Here, an attempt to queue a task                //这里，一个尝试入队任务的线程，若此时线程池中没有多余的线程立即处理运行任务，则入队失败，可能线程池直接创建一个新线程处理
 * will fail if no threads are immediately available to run it, so a
 * new thread will be constructed. This policy avoids lockups when                 //这种策略避免了当处理一系列任务请求时为了线程安全加锁的动作
 * handling sets of requests that might have internal dependencies.                //所以，这种策略通常需要设置一个没有边界的(较大的)maximumPoolSize,为了避免新提交的任务被抛弃
 * Direct handoffs generally require unbounded maximumPoolSizes to
 * avoid rejection of new submitted tasks. This in turn admits the
 * possibility of unbounded thread growth when commands continue to                //换言之，当此时到达一大波比平时线程池能够处理的更快更多的任务时，可能线程池中的线程会没有边界地增长
 * arrive on average faster than they can be processed.  </li>
 *
 * <li><em> Unbounded queues.</em> Using an unbounded queue (for                    //【Unbounded queues 策略】：
 * example a {@link LinkedBlockingQueue} without a predefined                       //例如使用没有预先定义容量的LinkedBlockingQueue
 * capacity) will cause new tasks to wait in the queue when all                     //这种策略会导致当所有的核心线程繁忙时，新的请求任务将会直接入队列等待处理
 * corePoolSize threads are busy. Thus, no more than corePoolSize                   //同时意味着不会有超过核心线程数的线程被创建（最大线程数maximumPoolSize配置没有意义）
 * threads will ever be created. (And the value of the maximumPoolSize
 * therefore doesn't have any effect.)  This may be appropriate when                //这种策略也许适合每个任务完全独立于其他任务，任务彼此间不会相互影响（因为队列容量没有边界，不会因为一种任务过多导致其他任务入队不了）
 * each task is completely independent of others, so tasks cannot                   //这种策略有用于在web应用种，当某一时刻请求突发，这种队列可以无限的增长。(可能会造成内存溢出)
 * affect each others execution; for example, in a web page server.
 * While this style of queuing can be useful in smoothing out
 * transient bursts of requests, it admits the possibility of
 * unbounded work queue growth when commands continue to arrive on
 * average faster than they can be processed.  </li>
 *
 * <li><em>Bounded queues.</em> A bounded queue (for example, an                    //【Bounded queues 策略】：
 * {@link ArrayBlockingQueue}) helps prevent resource exhaustion when               //例如使用有界的ArrayBlockingQueue(同时配置有限的最大线程数)
 * used with finite maximumPoolSizes, but can be more difficult to                  //这种策略可以帮助预防资源的耗尽，但是比较难调整和控制队列容量和最大线程数：
 * tune and control.  Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes may be traded
 * off for each other: Using large queues and small pools minimizes                 //如果使用较大的队列容量和较小的线程数，虽然会使cpu资源，os资源，线程上下文切换降到最小，但是会人为地导致线程池吞吐量减少：
 * CPU usage, OS resources, and context-switching overhead, but can                 //尤其是当线程池中任务有I/O阻塞时，此时cpu会被释放，系统可以调度更多的线程（但是现在线程大小被人为的设置的很小）
 * lead to artificially low throughput.  If tasks frequently block (for
 * example if they are I/O bound), a system may be able to schedule
 * time for more threads than you otherwise allow. Use of small queues
 * generally requires larger pool sizes, which keeps CPUs busier but                //如果使用较小的队列和较大的线程大小，这样虽然会保持cpu的充分工作，但是会带来无法接受的线程调度开销，这样也会降低线程池的吞吐量
 * may encounter unacceptable scheduling overhead, which also
 * decreases throughput.  </li>

     * running, we get tasks from getTask. If it returns null then the
     * worker exits due to changed pool state or configuration
     * parameters.  Other exits result from exception throws in
     * external code, in which case completedAbruptly holds, which
     * usually leads processWorkerExit to replace this thread.
     *
     * 2. Before running any task, the lock is acquired to prevent
     * other pool interrupts while the task is executing, and
     * clearInterruptsForTaskRun called to ensure that unless pool is
     * stopping, this thread does not have its interrupt set.
     *
     * 3. Each task run is preceded by a call to beforeExecute, which
     * might throw an exception, in which case we cause thread to die
     * (breaking loop with completedAbruptly true) without processing
     * the task.
     *
     * 4. Assuming beforeExecute completes normally, we run the task,
     * gathering any of its thrown exceptions to send to
     * afterExecute. We separately handle RuntimeException, Error
     * (both of which the specs guarantee that we trap) and arbitrary
     * Throwables.  Because we cannot rethrow Throwables within
     * Runnable.run, we wrap them within Errors on the way out (to the
     * thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler).  Any thrown exception also
     * conservatively causes thread to die.
     *
     * 5. After task.run completes, we call afterExecute, which may
     * also throw an exception, which will also cause thread to
     * die. According to JLS Sec 14.20, this exception is the one that
     * will be in effect even if task.run throws.
     *
     * The net effect of the exception mechanics is that afterExecute
     * and the thread's UncaughtExceptionHandler have as accurate
     * information as we can provide about any problems encountered by
     * user code.
